Map of arrests is an application for Android/iOS which would permit 
the person arrested to inform his relatives by pressing one button, 
place his location at the arrest on the Ushahidi-based map.

His relatives will be able to contribute with info on his arrest 
and trial details visualizing how many and which judges misuse 
their powers to send activists to prison + the stats on aggregated 
fines and sentences.
